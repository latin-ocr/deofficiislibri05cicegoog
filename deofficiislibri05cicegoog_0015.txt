being uanslated, have been very much changedin their ferm, by being -
ahridged, condensed, and otherwise modified3 and in some cases so
much so, that it seemed hardly fair toimpute the note in its new shape
to its real author. Some comments, therefore, will appear ιο be claim-
ed for this edition as orIginal, which, by suggestion at least, are due to
another. But it will be very easy for any one, who has the authors
enumerated in the beginning of this preface, to see for himself ιο what
extent the notes are derived from others. A slight comparison will
show that the present editor has had little ιο. de, hut to use his judg-
ment, in selecting from the abundant materiale furnished by able schol-
ars, and in preparing what he should select for American studente.
No part of the writings of Cicero has* been more fortunate than the

. De Officiis in respect to the preservation and perfeeting of its text, nor
will it suffer in comparison with any in regard ιο the ahility with which
its text has been illustrated and explained. If the book,n0w, not with-
out diffidence, presented ιο the public, shall have contributed any thing
to make the valuahle labors‘ of others more extensively available, its
objectwill have been accomplished. It has been prepared in the midst
of other duties, and retarded in its preparation by the repeated and pro-
tracted illness of its editor, and might put in a plea for the indulgence
which it will douhtless need.

In the first chapter of the second book, Cicero expresses the appre-
hension, that some good men may. find fault with his devotion to philo&
ophy. He vindicates himself, however, by saying that he can no
longer henefit the commonwealth by his care and counsels, inasmuch
as it is now under the tyrannical control of one man. He must,
therefore, give his activity a new direction. Το yield ιο patriotic grief,

to philosophy for relies. It had been a fayorite study of his youth, and,
in the midst of active life, he had devoted ιο it whattime he could gain
from professional and political duties. Nor does he turn to philosophy
for relief merely. He 18 still influenced by patriotic motives3 for he
