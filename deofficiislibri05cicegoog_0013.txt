er edition, ’¹‘ varied in a very few instances on the authority of Beier,
Orelli, and Bonnell, and of Zumpt himself. The deviations from
Zumpt’s text are generally, if not in every case, accounted for in the

notes-

'l'he notes are derived chiefly from the editions of Zumpt and Bon·
nell ,ἦ which contain, besides their own, the valuable remarks and expla-
nations of the Heusingers and of Degen. Beier and Gemhard have
also been frequently consulted, and especially the notes and treafiees
of Gnrve, who discusses so thoroughly, and in so lucid a manner, the
ideas contained ιιι this work of Cicero. There is an occasional refer·
ence also to the edition of Stuerenburg, to the German interpretation
andnotesofDr. A. W. Zumpuand to thereviewof Bonnell in the
Neue Jahrbucher, numbers 2 and 3, of the 55th volume. The render
has been referred to Freund' s Latin Lexicon, without any citation of
the information required, because it is understood that an American
edition of that excellent work, prepared under the superintendence of a
mature and reliable scholar, is soon to be presented to the public. ·

the great body of them. As a general thing, all biographical and his-
torical notes have been omimd. It was thought that lem-nera in this

considerable length the information necessary for the elucidation of
the text, that it was better to allow them to consult their manuale
