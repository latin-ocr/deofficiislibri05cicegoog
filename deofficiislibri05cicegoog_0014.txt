scanty. The example of the German editors already named, and lna
deod of almost all German commentatore, can, it isgtruo, be quoted for
a different course. But it should be borne in mind* that they prepare
their works for those who are not supplied with these books of refer·
enee. A German commentaryis a transcript of the instructions of the
class-roem, where oral teaching takes the place of silent study, and, to
a great extent, supplies the want of manuale. Such a commentary
therefore contains all the explanatione which its author has been ac-
customed to give to his class 3 not only grammatical and critical com-
ments‚ but those also which pertain to geography, history, biography,

- and antiquities. It should be obsemd, however, that German pupils

do not, as 8 general rule, make use of such commentarios, but of the
unadorned text of the authors they study. In this edition, 8 few notes
of the historical class spoken of have been introduced, 111 88888 where
the dictionaries in common use have not been found to contain the de-
sired information. ' τ ·
The general design of the brief commentary is two-feld: first, to
aid the learner in understanding the contente of the treatise, the
thoughts and connectione of thought of the author 3 and second, to
explain grammatical difficulties, and> especially to inculcate a know-
ledge of grammatica principles. The editor has aimed throughout to
guide rather than carry the learner through difficulties, requiring of
him more study in consequence of his help, than he would probably
have devoted to the book without it. There will be found frequent
references to the grammars where there is no difficulty in translating
and understanding the author, and that for the mere purpose of in·
forming or reminding the learner of some law of the language. Δ To
some these references will undouboedly seem too numerous. They
will seem to leave to the careful student too little opportunity to ex-
ercise his own ingenuity, to leave him no difficulties to solve himself.
There is much force in this objection‚ and in the preparation of some
works for the use of learners it ought to prevail. But yet, considering
the attainments of the great body of studente who would be likely to
read this book3 would not more on the whole 118 gained by a multipli-
