5. Having shown that man is the chief source of good and ill to man,
Cicero proceeds now to the connection of this fact with ethice. The obseu-
rity of the passage is somewhat removed by the following paraphrase of it ·
by Gai-ve: If therefore this proposition is beyond a doubt—that nothing is
so useful and so har-mful to men as man—it also seems to me tobe estab-
lished, that it is virtue which makes the hearts of men our own, and inspires
them with the dispositions which our inter-ests require. -That utility then
which accrues to human lise from inanimate objects and from the use and
management of animals, although it aleo comes to us throuyh men, is yet
the work of only a class of them, to wit, common laboret-s and those en-
gaged in the mechania arts. But the advantages which we can derivo

=from the good- -will and attachment of men in general for the promotion of
our happiness or our advaneement, these the great {and wise man must
’ secure for himself by his virtues.

It will be perceived that the force of itaque (ἓ 6) falls on the second
part of the sentence, hominum amm studia. mimate excitam, the
things spoken of ιιι the former pm being proper objecta of purchase, or
such as ean be secui-ed otherwise than by means of virtue. Zumpt gives
the sense of ἓ 6 thus: AEdium constructio, lanificium, bellum-um captura,
usus, cure, cetera, suae quidque arti tribuitur, hominum gratiae comparanda
ars non est propria quaedam praeter ipsam virtutem.
