The present Manuale of Greek and Roman Antiquities are far supe-
rior to any thing on the same topice as yet offered to the American
public. A principal Review of Germany says of the Roman Manuale
“small as the compes: of it is, we may confidently affirm that it is a
great improvement on all preceding works of the kind. We no longer
meet with the wretched old method‚ in which subjecte essentially dis-
tinct are herded together, and connected subjecte disconnected, but
have a simple, systematic arrangement, by which the reader readily
receives a clear representation of Roman life. We n‘o longer stumble
against countless errore in detail, which, though long ago assailed and

extirpated by Neibuhr and others, have found their last place of refuge
in our manuals’·

This work covers a period from the Invesion of Julius Oaesar to the
Reign of Victoria containing questions adapted to the use of schools
in this country.

“Mrs. Markham’s Histoi-y was used by that model for all toachers,
the late Dr. Arnold, master of the great English school at Rugby, and
agrees in its character with his enlightened and picus views of teach-
ing history. It is now several years since Ι adapted this history to the
form and price acceptable in the schools in the United scates. 1 have
recently revised it, and trust that it may be extensively servioeable in
education.

“The principal alterations from the original are a ne'w and more
convenient division of paragraphs, and entire omission of the eonver-
sations‘annexed to the chapters. In the place of these 1 hove affixed
questions to every pege that may at once facilitate the work of the
teacher and the pupil. The rational and moral features of this book
first commended itselt to me, and Ι have used it successfully with my

own scholares-Eximat from ‘'h-‘American Editor& Prffaoa
