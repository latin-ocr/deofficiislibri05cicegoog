θ The text of thia editionis that of Orelli‚' ιιι the edition of 1843-44

the comparatively few readings of Orelli, not adopted, are given at the
foot of the page. The most important various readings are aleo given
in feet-notes. 'The method 'purcued in the preparation of the Notee i·
the same aa that followed by the Editor in his edition of Livy, except
so far ae it ia modified by the character of the present author, and by
the fact that hie writinge belong to a later stage in a eourae of claeaieal
studies. while the grammatieal stndy of the lauffuage hae been kept
in view, it has been a chet-iahed object to take advantage of the meane

ιο variously aud riehly furniehed by Horace for promoting the literary
culture of the student.
