6, 7. Princepsque . . . . esse maaeimum] Garve remarks, not without rea-
son, that Cicero‘s second metaphysical reason at the first· glauce seems to
leadtothe opposite ofthatwhich hevvishestoprove. “It seems 81181811,
that, because acertainkind ofwisdom isths first of auvireues, therefore
the effort to obtain wisdom is not the first of all duties. The opposite 0011-
clusion appears the most natural. If the knowledge of the natme of God
and man is the highest perfectiom then, to be sure, the endeavor to secure
this knowledge, and consequently the investigationi of 888110, must be the
first duty. Cicero nevertheless hits *upon a mean, by which he unites the
two propositions apparently so contradictory. This wisdom, which is the
highest virtue of man, is the lmowledg'e of the relations in which he stands3
and these relations, 80 far as he 088 survey them, are no other than those
in which he stands to God and his follow· men.” Anmerkungea 1, 212.
